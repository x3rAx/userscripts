My Personal Userscripts
=======================

This is a collection of userscripts I have created. The main purpose of this
repository is to have a place where I can store my scripts while also having
them syncted across multiple browsers / machines.

You are free to use any of the scripts here but **you do this at your own
responsibility**

Even though I'm a fan of clean code, some scripts here might be super ugly
because sometimes I just want to have something right now. I apologize for
that in advance. :yum:



### Contributing

If you have some cool idea, I'd apreciate if you fork and send me a pull request
and if it fits my needs, I will eventually merge it in.
